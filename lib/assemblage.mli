(** The Assemblage Library.

    [Assemblage] provides a simple embedded domain specific language
    to describe [OCaml] {{!projects}projects}. It also provides simple
    tools to configure, manage, install and use OCaml projects.

    Describing a project eventually leads to describe its build
    artifacts. The exact mapping betweem project elements and those
    build artifacts depends on the presence or absence of
    {{!Features}features}. Examples of such features are whether to
    compile and run the tests (user-defined feature), the presence of
    the native compiler (system-dependant feature), compiling a
    library using [async] or [lwt] as a backend (environment-dependant
    feature), ...

    Finally, generating build artifacts means refining the project
    description into concrete {{!Flags}command line arguments} to pass
    to the different compilers ([ocamlc], [ocamlopt]) on the different
    compilation and linking phases.

(** {1:featuresandflags Features and flags} *)

  (** Features.

      Features declare booleans to be determined by the
      {{!buildenv}build environment}. They allow to condition the
      application of certain {{!Flags}flags} and restrict the build of
      project components or of certain of their artifacts.

      Examples of features are: native compilation availability,
      optional package availability, debug build support, etc. *)
